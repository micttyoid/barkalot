# Barkalot: C++ Refresher in half tilt

## Why is this project named "Barkalot"?

It's a jinx of mine that the two dogs in my place, most of time I work on
this project, [bark](https://recruiter-magnet.lukeyoo.fyi/static/audio/barks.mp3), 
howl, or
[cry out](https://recruiter-magnet.lukeyoo.fyi/static/audio/cryouts.mp3) 
pretty intensively. They must hate C++.
